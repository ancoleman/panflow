# PAN-OS XML utilities: Refactored package structure

Based on research of best practices in Python package organization and XML handling, I've created code for the six required modules for your refactored PAN-OS XML utilities project. Each module includes comprehensive documentation and follows modern Python practices.

## core/xml_utils.py

This module provides general-purpose XML utilities for working with PAN-OS configurations:

- Support for both ElementTree and lxml (with graceful fallback)
- XML parsing, navigation, and manipulation functions
- Custom exception hierarchy for XML operations
- Special handling for PAN-OS XPath expressions
- Helper functions for element creation and modification
- Utilities for XML validation and merging

Key features include:
- Type annotations for better IDE support
- Support for XPath operations with namespaces
- Built-in error handling with custom exceptions
- Functions for deep copying and merging XML elements

## core/config_saver.py

This module focuses on saving and exporting XML configurations:

- ConfigSaver class for handling all configuration saving operations
- Support for saving XML trees, elements, and strings
- Backup creation before overwriting files
- Pretty printing and formatting options
- JSON export functionality
- Timestamped saving for configuration history
- Archive creation for configuration backups
- Validation before saving

The module also implements helpful features like:
- Creating parent directories automatically
- Converting XML to structured dictionaries
- Custom validation support

## constants/common.py

This module defines constants used throughout the project:

- XML namespaces specific to PAN-OS
- Common XPath expressions for navigating PAN-OS configurations
- Default values for common configuration elements
- Error codes and messages
- API response codes from Palo Alto Networks
- Configuration file paths
- Content types for API requests
- Tag and attribute names
- Security action constants
- Log settings
- Validation rules and limits

## Package __init__.py files

The three __init__.py files follow modern Python package organization best practices:

- **constants/__init__.py**: Exports all constants from the common module
- **modules/__init__.py**: Reserved for future module exports
- **core/__init__.py**: Exports key functions and classes from xml_utils and config_saver

Each __init__.py file uses __all__ to explicitly define the public API and includes proper docstrings explaining the package purpose.

## Usage examples

Here's a simple example of how to use these modules:

```python
from core import parse_xml, find_elements, ConfigSaver
from constants import XPATH

# Parse a PAN-OS configuration file
tree, root = parse_xml("firewall_config.xml")

# Find all address objects
address_objects = find_elements(root, XPATH['ADDRESS_OBJECTS'])

# Create a ConfigSaver and save a modified configuration
saver = ConfigSaver(config_dir="backups")
saver.save_with_timestamp(root, "firewall_backup")
```

These modules provide a solid foundation for the refactored PAN-OS XML utilities project, following best practices for Python package organization and XML handling.
