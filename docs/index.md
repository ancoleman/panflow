# PANFlow Documentation

Welcome to the PANFlow documentation! PANFlow is a comprehensive CLI tool and Python library for working with Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS XML configurations, supporting both Panorama and firewall configurations across multiple PAN-OS versions (10.1, 10.2, 11.0, 11.1, 11.2).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install panflow
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# List all address objects
panflow object list --config firewall.xml --type address

# Find duplicate objects
panflow deduplicate find --config panorama.xml --type service

# Query configurations with graph queries
panflow query execute --config config.xml --query "MATCH (a:address) WHERE a.name CONTAINS 'web' RETURN a.name, a.value"

# Natural language queries
panflow nlq query "show me all disabled security rules" --config config.xml --format html --report-file report.html
```
